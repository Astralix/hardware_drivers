currently liboverlay is based upon two hardware modules: OSDM and On2 Post-Processor

OSDM is handling composition and rotation.
Post-Processor is handling scaling and flipping.

The following list describe current limitations of the above hardware modules:

1. Post-Processor input frame must be aligned to 16 pixels on both axis.
2. Post-Processor output frame must be aligned to 2 pixels on both axis.
3. Post-Processor scale limitations:
	a. Maximum out_width = 3 * in_width		(out_width <= 3*in_width)
	b. Maximum out_height = 3 * in_height - 2	(out_height <= 3*in_height-2)
	c. Minimum out_width = in_width / 70		(out_width >= in_width/70)
	d. Minimum out_height = in_height / 70		(out_height >= in_height/70)
4. Post-Processor cannot scale width and height in different directions (example: up-scale width and down-scale height).
5. OSDM plane size must be aligned to 8 pixels on both axis (without using rotation).
6. OSDM plane size must be aligned to 64 pixels on both axis when using rotation!!!
