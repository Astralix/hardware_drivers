    libomxil-bellagio-0.9.3/build directory
  - G1 API headers and libraries are available
  - unzip testdata_customer.tar.gz to same directory with omxil

 2.) Configure and build G1 HW decoder component
  - set working directory to omxil/source/81x0_decoder
  - edit Makefile
    * Set correct path to BELLAGIO_ROOT variable
  - execute gmake
    * "gmake install"

  3.) Configure and build testclient for G1 HW decoder
   - set working directory to omxil/source/81x0_decoder/test
   - edit Makefile
     * Set correct compiler (CC)
   - execute gmake
     * "gmake install"
   - run
     * ./customer_test_g1.sh
