1. Introduction

Released modules:
 - OpenMAX IL encoder component for Hantro 7280 HW encoder
 - OpenMAX Test client

Required modules not included in this release:
 - Bellagio core implementation for OpenMAX (libomxil-bellagio-0.9.3)
  -> Configuration modified to install in BUILD directory
 - Hantro 7280 encoder product software


2. This release supports:
 - H264, MPEG4, H263 and JPEG formats for 7280 encoder
 - Conformant to OpenMAX IL v1.1.2 base profile


3. Building Instructions 
Release contains one component and test software for it:
- 7280 HW encoder (omxil/source/7280_encoder)
- testclient (omxil/source/testclient)


 1.) Preconditions:
  - libomxil-bellagio-0.9.3 is installed to libomxil-bellagio-0.9.3/build directory
  - 7280 API headers and libraries are available

 2.) Configure and build 7280 HW encoder component
  - set working directory to omxil/source/7280_encoder
  - edit Makefile
    * Set correct path to ENCODER_RELEASE and MEMALLOC_RELEASE variables
     * ENCODER_RELEASE should point to root directory of 7280 HW encoder release
     * MEMALLOC_RELEASE should point to directory where 7280 HW encoder memalloc headers are found
  - Execute gmake
    * "gmake install"

  3.) Configure and build testclient for 7280 HW encoder
   - set working directory to omxil/source/testclient
   - edit Makefile
     * Set correct compiler (CC) 
     * Set correct path to MEMALLOC_RELEASE variable
     * MEMALLOC_RELEASE should point to directory where tested components memalloc headers are found
   - Execute gmake
     * "gmake install"

  4.) Run tests
   - Set correct paths to SYSTEM_MODEL_HOME, TEST_DATA_HOME and YUV_SEQUENCE_HOME as described in omxil/source/testclient/README
   - Run 
        >./test_h264.sh [ 1 | 1000 1100 | all ]
        >./test_mpeg4.sh [ 1 | 1000 1100 | all ]	
        >./test_jpeg.sh [ 1 | 2000 2100 | all ]

4. Compatible Products and Environments
This product has been tested on the following product:
- 7280 HW encoder


5. Implemented Features
The following features appear in this release:
- H264 encoder
- MPEG4 encoder
- H263 encoder
- JPEG encoder
- OMX Tunneling

6. Debugging and Tracing

Encoder:
 For logging use DENCODER_TRACE for CFLAGS in Makefile
 CFLAGS +=-DENCODER_TRACE


7. Known Bugs and Limitations

7280 HW encoder:
   OpenMAX Interop profile implementation doesn't support suspension.
   OpenMAX Interop profile implementation doesn't support resource management.
