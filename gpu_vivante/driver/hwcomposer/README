Overview
========

  HWComposer is used by surfaceflinger to enhance composition from android
honeycomb and later. Vivante HWComposer can not 2D blit, multi-source blit for
that purpose.
  Vivante HWComposer depends on EGL_ANDROID_get_render_buffer extension. To
enable HWComposer, that extension is need to be there.
  Vivante HWComposer can support plane alpha (global alpha) and dim layer.
To enable plane alpha and dim, please patch hwcomposer.h.
  Please reference 'README' file in hwcomposer_android_patch patckage for more
information.


Overlay Integration Guide
=========================

1. Some overlay devices can only display areas which are cleared as transparet
   in framebuffer. If your device is like that, please make sure
   'CLEAR_FB_FOR_OVERLAY' is set to '1' in 'gc_hwc.h'.

2. Please add your own code in 'hwcOverlay' function (gc_hwc_overlay.cpp) to
   do actual overlay functionalities.


Prepare
=======

  1. Patch android system to support EGL_ANDROID_get_render_buffer extension.
  2. Patch android system to support dim/plane alpha.
  3. Please set proper optimization switch in 'gc_hwc.h' if needed.

=====

  Build HWComposer like a normal android project (type 'mm' to build).


Known Issues

1) 2D PE 1.x is not supported.
2) COVERAGE alpha blending is not exactly correct in alpha channel.
