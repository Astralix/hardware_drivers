#
# This is the configuration file for Vivante GFX plug-in driver.
# You can use this file to control which primitive is accelerated
# with specific features.
#
# e.g. If you want to accelerate blit with alpha blending and rotate180
#      features, please add the following line in the file.
#      blit=alphachannel,coloralpha,rotate180
#
#      Then blit with other features (including xor and src_colorkey etc.)
#      are not accelerated by HW. Even blit without any features is not
#      accelerated also.
#      "none" in the feature list means the rendering primitive without
#      any features.
#
# Following is the full matrix of the primitives and features.
#
#      drawline=none,xor,blend
#      drawrectangle=none,xor,blend
#      fillrectangle=none,xor,blend
#      filltriangle=none,xor,blend
#      blit=none,xor,alphachannel,coloralpha,src_colorkey,rotate180
#      stretchblit=none,xor,alphachannel,coloralpha,src_colorkey,rotate180
#
# To use this configuration file, please set envionment variable GAL_CONFIG_FILE
# pointing to this file.
#
# e.g. For bash user.
#      export GAL_CONFIG_FILE=/home/gfx/gc_dfb_config
#
# If you don't set the envionment variable, a default configuration matrix
# will be used.
#
# The default configuration matrix is listed below.
#
#     fillrectangle=none,xor,blend
#     filltriangle=none,xor,blend
#     filltriangle=none,xor,blend
#     blit=none,xor,alphachannel,coloralpha,src_colorkey,rotate180
#     stretchblit=none,xor,alphachannel,coloralpha,src_colorkey,rotate180
#
# Configuration file has higher priority.
