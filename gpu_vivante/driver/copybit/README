Vivante Copybit Engine for Android

Overview
========
 This is the Vivante copybit module for Android. It depends on Vivante's Gralloc module,
 and Vivante Graphics Access Layer (libGAL.so). Copybit can be used to accelerate the
 SurfaceFlinger compositor.

Build
=====
 The copybit module is built as part of the Vivante driver build. Make sure USE_2D_COMPOSITION
 is set to 1 in Android.mk.def.

 Copybit also requires surfaceflinger and libagl modules to be patched. The patch file,

 0001-copybit-support-wrt-gingerbread-4d53cb02168fe35104d7.patch

 generated against the standard gingerbread release from Google, should be provided in the
 release package.

Usage
=====
 Make sure that you have the following entry in /system/build.prop on your target device.
 This enables SurfaceFlinger to use the copybit path.

 debug.sf.hw=0

 Also make sure the file /system/lib/egl/egl.cfg has the following entries. This makes sure
 SurfaceFlinger can find the s/w implementation of the OpenGL|ES 1.1 driver while other
 applications use the GPU accelerated version.
