5. Specific stuffs

1. Quick start
==============

1) Uncompress the source code, and set the root directory of driver source code.

   # Please make sure driver and test source package are unzipped in different directory.
   # <PROJECTS_DIR> must be a full path.
   export PROJECTS_DRIVER_DIR=<PROJECTS_DIR>/DRIVER
   mkdir -p $PROJECTS_DRIVER_DIR
   tar zxvf VIVANTE_GAL_Unified_Src_drv_<version>.tgz -C $PROJECTS_DRIVER_DIR.

   # Set the root directory of driver source code.
   export AQROOT=$PROJECTS_DRIVER_DIR

2) Set the environment variables.

   # Please make sure there is NO trailing '/' in AQARCH.
   export AQARCH=<PROJECTS_DRIVER_DIR>/arch/XAQ2

   # Set cross compile tool chain.
   export CROSS_COMPILE=<CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX>

   # Set the Linux kernel directory.
   export KERNEL_DIR=<PATH_TO_LINUX_KERNEL_SOURCE>

   # Set X11 installation path.
   # If you are not using X11 as the GUI system, this variable is not necessary.
   export X11_ARM_DIR=<PATH_TO_X11_STUFF>

   # Set DirectFB installation path.
   # If you are not building gfx driver, this variable is not necessary.
   export DFB_DIR=<PATH_TO_DIRECTFB_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>

   # Set the tool chain path.
   export TOOLCHAIN=<PATH_TO_TOOLCHAIN_TOPDIR>

   # Set the static library path which contains libc.a, etc.
   # If you are not building the package with static link, this variable is not necessary.
   export LIB_DIR=<PATH_TO_STATIC_LIBRARIES>

   # The binaries will be installed at this directory.
   # By default, SDK_DIR=$AQROOT/build/sdk, you can modify it as following:
   DRIVER_SDK_DIR=<PATH_TO_INSTALL_BINARIES>
   export SDK_DIR=$DRIVER_SDK_DIR

   # Add the tool chain to the PATH.
   export PATH=$TOOLCHAIN/bin:$PATH

   # We use arm-2010q1 tool chain to compile this package.

3) Build.

   cd $AQROOT

   make -f makefile.linux
   make -f makefile.linux install

   The binaries are installed at <SDK_DIR>.
   More build options please see 'Build commands'.

4) Run the applications.

   Move to the target board.

   a) Copy <SDK_DIR> to the target board.

   b) Create device node.
      mknod /dev/galcore c 199 0

   c) Insert the kernel driver.
      insmod <SDK_DIR>/drivers/galcore.ko registerMemBase=<REG_MEM_BASE> irqLine=<IRQ> contiguousSize=<CONTIGUOUS_MEM_SIZE>

   d) Set environment variable.

      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<SDK_DIR>/drivers

   e) Run the application.

	  eg. Run tutorial1.

	  cd <SDK_DIR>/samples/tutorial
	  ./tutorial1

2. Prerequisite
===============

1) Build the Linux kernel

   Before building the driver, you need a pre-compiled Linux source code tree.

   The driver needs a large piece of contiguous physical memory.
   So you should enlarge the memory zone in the kernel.

   You can choose either way to do so depends on how you build the driver.

   a) Build the driver with NO_DMA_COHERENT=1

   You need to enlarge the MAX_ORDER.

   Add "#define MAX_ORDER 15" in linux/include/linux/mmzone.h.

   b) Build the driver with NO_DMA_COHERENT=0 (the default value)

   You should enlarge both the MAX_ORDER and CONSISTENT_DMA_SIZE.

   Add "#define MAX_ORDER 15" in linux/include/linux/mmzone.h.
   Change "#define CONSISTENT_DMA_SIZE SZ_32M" in linux/include/asm-arm/memory.h.

                   [BANK_CHANNEL_BIT] When set to no-zero, video memory when allocated bank aligned is allocated such
                                      that render and depth buffer addresses alternate on the channel bit specified.
                                      This option has an effect only when gcdENABLE_BANK_ALIGNMENT is enabled.

4. Run the applications
=======================

Move to the target board.

1) Copy <SDK_DIR> to the target board.

2) Create the device node.

   mknod /dev/galcore c 199 0

3) Insert the kernel driver.

   There are two kinds of ways to manage the video memory: pre-reserved and
   dynamically allocated.

   We must pass the correct parameters to the driver according to these two conditions.

   a) Reserve a piece of memory from the system.

      insmod <SDK_DIR>/drivers/galcore.ko registerMemBase=<REG_MEM_BASE> irqLine=<IRQ> contiguousBase=<CONTIGUOUS_MEM_BASE> contiguousSize=<CONTIGUOUS_MEM_SIZE>

   b) Allocate a piece of memory dynamically when the driver boots up.

      insmod <SDK_DIR>/drivers/galcore.ko registerMemBase=<REG_MEM_BASE> irqLine=<IRQ> contiguousSize=<CONTIGUOUS_MEM_SIZE>

4) Set environment variable.

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<SDK_DIR>/drivers

   Add additional paths to LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you are use other extra libraries.

5) Run the application.

   eg. Run tutorial1.

   cd <SDK_DIR>/samples/tutorial
   ./tutorial1

5. Specific cases
=================

We list some specific cases below for your reference.

1) Build DirectFB accelerator for DirectFB driver

   a) Build DirectFB package.
   We are using DirectFB-1.4.15 as this release, you can download the follow
   source code from www.directfb.org/downloads/Core/DirectFB-1.4/DirectFB-1.4.15.tar.gz.
    # DirectFB library
    DirectFB-1.4.15

   There are more build requirements depending on the configuration you want,
   check http://www.directfb.org/downloads/Core/DirectFB-1.4/README for more
   detail please.

   We enable the following supports when building DirectFB library:
     1) compressed screenshot support (also needed by libpng): zlib1g-dev
     2) JPEG images support: libjpeg-dev
     3) Portable Network Graphics support: libpng-dev
     4) TrueType and other fonts support: libfreetype6-dev

   We download the follow libraries from Internet to get those support above:
    zlib-1.2.3
    libpng-1.2.29
    jpeg-6b
    freetype-2.3.5

   To support running multiple DirectFB applications, you also need to download
   linux-fusion librarye from www.directfb.org.
   We use linux-fusion-8.7.0 for the multi application core support.

   Cross compile the packages and install the libraries and head files into
   <DIRECTFB_DIR>. At the same time copy them to the target board at the same
   directory - <DIRECTFB_DIR>.

   We have attached a script named as build_dfb.sh in <PROJECT_DIR>/release/SW
   on how to configure and cross compile DirectFB-1.4.15.

   You can take it as a reference.

   b) Build DirectFB accelerator.

   export AQROOT=<PROJECTS_DIR>
   export AQARCH=<PROJECTS_DIR>/arch/XAQ2
   export CROSS_COMPILE=<CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX>
   export KERNEL_DIR=<PATH_TO_LINUX_KERNEL_SOURCE>
   export DFB_DIR=<DIRECTFB_DIR>
   export TOOLCHAIN=<PATH_TO_TOOLCHAIN_TOPDIR>
   export SDK_DIR=<PATH_TO_INSTALL_BINARIES>
   export PATH=$TOOLCHAIN/bin:$PATH

   # Set the ABI to the same when build the Linux kernel if need.
   export BUILD_OPTIONS="$BUILD_OPTIONS ABI=aapcs-linux"

   make -f makefile.linux $BUILD_OPTIONS gfx
   make -f makefile.linux $BUILD_OPTIONS gfx V_TARGET=install

   We have attached a build script named as build_sample.sh in <PROJECT_DIR>/release/SW.
   You can take it as a reference.

   The library libdirectfb_gal.so is installed at <SDK_DIR>/drivers.

   c) Run the tests.

   Move to the target board.

   Copy libdirectfb_gal.so to <DFB_DIR>/lib/directfb-1.4-6/gfxdrivers.

   Follow section 3 Run the applications' 1), 2) and 3) to setup the environment.

   Then edit ~/.directfbrc as the follwing:

		# directfbrc begin

		system=fbdev
		mode=640x480					# change to fit your needs
		desktop-buffer-mode=frontonly	# if no double buffering in frame
										# buffer driver
		depth=16
		pixelformat=RGB16
		#no-hardware					# disable hardware acceleration
		#no-software					# disable software fallbacks

		# directfbrc end

   Set the environment variable.

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<DIRECTFB_DIR>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   Run the applications.

   e.g.

   cd <SDK_DIR>/samples/gfx

   ./draw_line

   By the way, you can download more DirectFB samples from www.directfb.org:
   http://www.directfb.org/downloads/Extras/DirectFB-examples-1.5.3.tar.gz.

   d) Use the configuration file to get more control on GFX.

   You can find a reference configuration file at
   $AQROOT/driver/gfx/gal_config.

   This is the configuration file for Vivante GFX plug-in driver.
   You can use this file to control which primitive is accelerated
   with specific features.

   e.g. If you want to accelerate blit with alpha blending and rotate180
        features, please add the following line in the file.
        blit=alphachannel,coloralpha,rotate180

        Then blit with other features (including xor and src_colorkey etc.)
        are not accelerated by HW. Even blit without any features is not
        accelerated also.
        "none" in the feature list means the rendering primitive without
        any features.

   Following is the full matrix of the primitives and features.

        drawline=none,xor,blend
        drawrectangle=none,xor,blend
        fillrectangle=none,xor,blend
        filltriangle=none,xor,blend
        blit=none,xor,alphachannel,coloralpha,src_colorkey,rotate180
        stretchblit=none,xor,alphachannel,coloralpha,src_colorkey,rotate180

   To use the configuration file, please set environment variable GAL_CONFIG_FILE
   pointing to this file.

   e.g. For bash user.
        export GAL_CONFIG_FILE=/home/gfx/gal_config

   If you don't set the environment variable, a default configuration matrix
   will be used.

   The default configuration matrix is listed below.

       fillrectangle=none,xor,blend
       filltriangle=none,xor,blend
       filltriangle=none,xor,blend
       blit=none,xor,alphachannel,coloralpha,src_colorkey,rotate180
       stretchblit=none,xor,alphachannel,coloralpha,src_colorkey,rotate180

   Configuration file has higher priority.
